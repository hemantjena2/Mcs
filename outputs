1.MSC(3rd column,black cylinder) place in middle.
2.From 5th column, take tower and place in left of MSC.
3.From 1st column take 6 mobile and place connected to tower.
4.Take Link from 4th column and connect MSC to tower.
5.Take Application from 10th column.
6.Go to MSC properties>interface>datalink layer>2nd uplink>change to 890.2
7.Go to Application properties>source_ID>3dest_ID>4
Call>inter_arrival_time>10
Service type>CBR
8.Add another application where source_ID>5dest_ID>6 and so on, and then run simulation
